# Ticket System 
<p>
This site was built as a demo project for my portfolio. It demonstrates
the base functionalities of a Ticket System. <br>
It can handle basic actions such as:
<ol>
<li className="aboutList">Create ticket</li>
<li className="aboutList">View ticket</li>
<li className="aboutList">Update ticket</li>
<li className="aboutList">Delete ticket</li>
<li className="aboutList">Assign ticket to user</li>
<li className="aboutList">Comment ticket</li>
<li className="aboutList">View comments</li>
<li className="aboutList">View all tickets</li>
<li className="aboutList">Filtering and sorting of tickets</li>
<li className="aboutList">Set ticket prioritities</li>
<li className="aboutList">Set ticket state</li>
</ol>
Currently it does not have a backend to store data, so any changes that
are made will be gone if you refresh the browser. <br>
Toggle between <b>Admin View </b>
or <b>Client View</b> to see how it works for both sides.
<br>
<br>
Some tickets are marked as <b>"Protected"</b> for demonstration
purposes.</p>
