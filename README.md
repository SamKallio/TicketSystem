# Ticket System

<p>
This project was built as a demo project for my portfolio. It demonstrates
the base functionalities of a Ticket System. <br>
It can handle basic actions such as:
<ul>
<li>Create ticket</li>
<li>View ticket</li>
<li>Update ticket</li>
<li>Delete ticket</li>
<li>Assign ticket to Team Member</li>
<li>Comment ticket</li>
<li>View comments</li>
<li>View all tickets</li>
<li>Filtering and sorting</li>
<li>Set ticket prioritities</li>
<li>Set ticket states</li>
</ul>
Currently it does not have a backend to store data, so any changes that
are made will be gone if you refresh the browser. <br>
Toggle between <b>Admin View </b>
or <b>Client View</b> to see how it works for both sides.
<br>
<br>
Some sample tickets are marked as <b>"Protected"</b> for demonstration
purposes.</p>
